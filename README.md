## Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hi, I'm Christoph ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±

With over 20 years of experience in sales and account management in the automotive industry, I have embarked on an exciting career shift to pursue my passion for technology and cloud engineering. As an AWS Certified Solutions Architect and Cloud Practitioner, I thrive on solving complex problems, learning new technologies, and building scalable solutions.

In addition to my cloud expertise, I am deeply invested in web development, with a particular focus on modern technologies like Vue and Tailwind CSS. When Iâ€™m not creating elegant digital solutions, you can find me producing beats and melodies in Ableton Live. Check out my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/jdam-nl) for a taste of my work!
